      <h5 class="card-title" style="color:white;">The Emanation of Unbecoming Comportment</h5>
      <p class="card-text" style="color:white;">Social interactions are interspersed with rules and norms that guide many aspects of our behaviour. Since the beginning of civilization, we have always adhered to social norms, told to always behave, act and live in a certain way. We fear breaking them would make us an outcast. But recently, people have called out such superfluous standards and realized neutrality encourages anything bu tself-morality. Unbecoming Comportment refers to the lifestyle not according to the standards appropriate to one's position or condition of life; because who decides one's way of living life? Oneself or the Society? <br>The essence of this theme lies in identifying the indifference between set practices and moral values prevalent in the modern world. Exploring established political and social norms, we aim to create a space to debate the highlights and challenges of establishing a suitable social image, restricting behaviour, demanding to curtail selfishness, or supressing personal goals. This morally discombobulating theme explores the rules set by society since the civilization of mankind and the mutiny brought by people in recent times.</p>

          <p class="card-text">The National level Fr. Conceicao Rodrigues Memorial Debate is a prestigious Debate Competition in Mumbai, hosted annually by Fr. Conceicao Rodrigues College of Engineering, Bandra.<br><br>
          CRMD has been a reputed platform for students all across the country for 8 years now. This year, in the face of COVID-19, we are organizing a 3 day virtual event on <b style="font-size: large">6th , 7th and 8th November 2020.</b><br><br>
          The debate aims to provide a forum for today’s youth to articulate views and engage in a dialogue on various affairs that affect the life of the common man, directly or otherwise while also showcasing the power of deploying rational, reasoned arguments and compelling evidence in action.<br><br>
          Our theme for this year is <b style="font-size: large"><u>Immanent Critique of Social Adiaphora.</u></b><br><br>
          The essence of the theme is social critique in a world which naturally neither means to debar or permit our actions while also exploring the personal virtues of an individual and how their ideas compare to the set practices. We identify the positive features of the prevailing social and political world order and open up intellectual space to challenge this world’s “immanent contradictions” to empowering a wider range of society.</p>
          <b style="font-size: large"><u>2 members per team and 1 team per college is allowed</u></b><br><br>
